# WP Menu Slow
Remove custom fields for WordPress menu when using Themeco
`remove_these.php` should speed up the WP Menu by blocking some of Themeco's actions, if it stops working then try increasing the priority

`add_filter.php` According to Rue at Themeco: "The code disables the feature to map custom fields to the WordPress menu system"

Place this code in a snippet or in your Functions.PHP file
